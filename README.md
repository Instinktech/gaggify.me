Get cloned
-------------

We love contribution! We write public codes. To get started, simply clone the code like:

	$ git clone https://github.com/Instinktech/gaggify.me.git
	$ cd gaggify.me && ls -l

You'll see that oil file there. This is the CLI script helps to create generators. It works like:

	$ sudo oil [...]

Once cloned, run the following command to let it refine:

	$ sudo oil refine install

This will make directories writable that are going to be used by application. Keep in mind about pointing your virtual host to the directory rather then browsing from relative url.


Whoa! It works!
